# CryptographyPlayground

Cryptography Playground allows you to play a little bit encrypting and decrypting messages based in some cryptography algorithms(Caesar, Morse).

## Notes 

* For the Caesar Cipher, i actually implemented a variation of it, that uses the ascii table for the character displacement instead of the usual alphabet letters. The reason i did that, it's because i thought it's a better approach, since in this way numbers and characters not in the alphabet are also changed in the encrypted message.

## Motivation

I just want to learn how to make GUIs with tkinter.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

## Installing

* Just git clone it : `git clone https://github.com/GabrielAlves/CryptographyPlayground.git`

## How to use

* Run the file *cryptography_playground.py* and the GUI will be called

## Screenshots

The GUI when you run *cryptography_playground.py*.

An example showing the GUI in portuguese. It's possible to change the language if it's defined in the *i18n* folder.
